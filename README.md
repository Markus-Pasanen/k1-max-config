# Creality K1 Max Klipper Config Backup

This repository contains backup configuration files for my Creality K1 Max 3D printer, which has been rooted and is running Vanilla Klipper firmware with Mainsail as the web interface.

## Purpose
This project is **not** a software project, but simply a backup of all my Klipper configuration files, macros, and related scripts for the K1 Max. It is intended for personal reference and disaster recovery.

## Printer Details
- **Printer:** Creality K1 Max
- **Firmware:** Vanilla Klipper
- **Web Interface:** Mainsail
- **Rooted:** Yes

## Contents
- Main configuration files (`printer.cfg`, `moonraker.conf`, etc.)
- Macro and helper scripts in `Helper-Script/`
- KAMP (Klipper Adaptive Meshing & Purging) configs in `Helper-Script/KAMP/`
- Backup snapshots of previous configurations

## Usage
These files are for backup and reference only. If you have a similar setup, you may find some macros or settings useful, but use at your own risk. Always review and adapt configs to your own hardware and firmware versions.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for personal use. No support or warranty is provided. Use any files at your own risk.
